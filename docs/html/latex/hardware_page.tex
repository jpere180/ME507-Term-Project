When developing the PCB design various capacitor, resistor, and inductor sizes were selected in regards to what our sensors required.\hypertarget{hardware_page_interfaces}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Pin Mappings}{Pin Mappings}}\label{hardware_page_interfaces}
The following image displays our teams PCB design and pin mapping outline developed for this project. To keep our board organized our team partitioned the board into three sections power, analog, and digital. The power section consist of voltage dividers dropping the 12V input to 5 volts and 3 volts. This section also consists of USB connections and a battery power supply. The analog section consist of FETS and houses our sensors and motor drivers.

Once our team decided on the amount and type of components we were able to assemble our PCB design. Our team used a four layer board with a minimum of trace size of 0.\+12. The image below displays an image of the develop design using Fusion 360.
