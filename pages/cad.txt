 * @section intro Introduction
 * This page provides documentation for the CAD designs and diagrams used for B.R.I.E. The overall manufacturing process for this droid is simple and includes 3D printing and the use of a lazer cutter. The overall manufacturing process took a estimated time of 3 days. It is important to note that our team desired to replicate a half scale model of the droid. The image below displays the develop 3D Model of the MSE-6 droid with the use of ultrasonic sensors and mecanum wheels attached to the four motors.
